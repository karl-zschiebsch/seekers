## Getting started

### Setup

You can install seekers by downloading prebuild wrapped binaries from Sourceforge or GitHub
or by building it on your own.
The prebuilt wrapped binaries do not require python but are only available for windows and linux.
If you are looking for darwin/macOS, you still need to build it on your own.

[![Download seekers-py](https://a.fsdn.com/con/app/sf-download-button)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/seekers-py/files/latest/download)

For building it on your own:
1. Clone this repository or download the latest release: `git clone https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-py.git`
2. Run the setup script: `bash setup.py` (linux) or `.\setup.bat` (win32)

### Create server and run clients

This will:
* start a Seekers Game
* run a gRPC server by default

```shell
python seekers.py <AI files>
```

### Run one single client

âš  You will need a separate server running. This can be the server above, or, for example, [the Java implementation](https://github.com/seekers-dev/seekers-api).

```shell
python client.py <AI file>
```
